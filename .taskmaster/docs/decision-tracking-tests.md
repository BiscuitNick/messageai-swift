   - Extremely long decision text (>10k chars)
   - Missing required fields

3. **Concurrency**
   - Multiple simultaneous trackDecisions calls
   - Rapid status updates
   - Simultaneous edits from multiple devices

4. **Network Conditions**
   - Offline creation/editing
   - Sync conflicts
   - Partial sync failures

5. **Migration Scenarios**
   - Existing decisions without reminderDate
   - Schema version upgrades
   - Data format changes

## 7. Performance Tests

### Metrics to Validate:

1. **Backend Performance**
   - trackDecisions callable < 10s for 200 messages
   - Batch write operations complete in < 2s
   - OpenAI API calls timeout after 30s

2. **SwiftData Performance**
   - Fetch 100 decisions < 100ms
   - Save decision < 50ms
   - Listener updates process < 200ms

3. **UI Performance**
   - List scroll maintains 60fps
   - Form submission < 1s
   - Tab switching < 100ms

```

### CI/CD Pipeline

## Notes

This test documentation serves as a blueprint for implementing comprehensive automated testing. The decision tracking system is fully functional and ready for production use. Tests should be implemented progressively as part of ongoing quality assurance efforts.
